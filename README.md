# Cadence.js
## A typing style monitor for input fields built as a jQuery plugin.
#### Author: Ryan McGowan

### A Quick Synopsis

Cadence.js is a simple jQuery plugin for collecting the timings of key strokes
when a user copies a given phrase.

The envisioned purpose is authentication.  Every person types with a specific
style.  You might have noticed that whenever you type an often used phrase you
do it from memory, and always with a specific *cadence*.  This library simply
captures that cadence. The server is responsible for using the returned data for
authentication.

### Why?

First of all, it was not my idea.  I read [this article by The New York
Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/18/business/seeking-ways-to-make-computer-passwords-unnecessary.html?_r=4&ref=technology)
and I liked the idea.

In order to use this idea on a website it has been simplified quite a bit.
**Cadence.js** monitors only a single field not all of the users typing.  Users
of the library supply it with a callback function which is given the generated
cadence object.

```javascript

    // An example cadence "result".
    {
        // The phrase the user typed in.
        phrase: "whatever phrase the user typed in",
        // An array of cadence entries. One for each character the user types
        // in.
        timeline: [
            {
                // The time (in seconds after the user started typing in the
                // cadence.
                time: 0,
                // The difference in time between this event and the last one.
                timeDifference: 0,
                // The keycode of the key the user typed in to trigger the
                // event.
                keyCode: 99,
                // The keycode converted to a character for your convenience.
                character: 'C'
            },
            {
                // ...another object like the one above.
            },
            // ...and more. One for each key the user types in.
        ]
    }

```

### What does it do exactly?

**Cadence.js** monitors a single input field and waits for the user to type in a
given phrase.  Here's an example of this in action:

```html

    <form id="trainer">
      <span id="given-phrase">Some phrase probably generated by the server</span>
      <input type="text" class="phrase" />
    </form>

    <script type="text/javascript">
        //Assuming the cadence library has already been loaded.
        jQuery(document).ready(function ($) {
          $("form#trainer").cadence(function (result) {
            // The callback we supply to simply writes the output with console.log
            console.log(result);
          });
        });
    </script>

```

##### Documentation

To generate documentation you'll want to use groc (it's kinda like docco).

    npm install -g groc
    # Now that you've installed groc just run it
    cd /path/to/this/project
    groc
